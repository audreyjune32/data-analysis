 Insights & Reporting
 1. Vaccination Rollout
India had the highest absolute vaccination numbers, while the USA led in percentage coverage.

2. Case Trends
New cases peaked sharply during the Delta and Omicron variants, especially in the USA.
3. Death Rate Disparities
Kenya had a higher fatality rate relative to total cases, highlighting healthcare access challenges.
4. Choropleth Findings
Case density maps show concentration in North America, India, and parts of Europe. Africa shows low cases but this may reflect data limitations.

1. Vaccination Rollout Comparison
ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ India showed the fastest increase in cumulative vaccinations in absolute numbers, while ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ the USA had one of the highest percentages of population fully vaccinated.
Project highlights and patterns
 a)Case Trends
Daily new cases in ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ peaked significantly in mid-2021 and early 2022, reflecting the impact of Delta and Omicron waves.

b) Death Rates
Although ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡ª Kenya reported fewer total cases, its case fatality rate (total_deaths / total_cases) was relatively high compared to developed nations â€” potentially due to limited healthcare access.

d) Anomalies
Some countries (like small island nations) reported vaccination rates over 100%, likely due to reporting errors or counting multiple doses per person.

e) Choropleth Map Observations
The choropleth revealed higher case densities in ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸, ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³, ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·, while many low-income countries had lower reported cases â€” this may be due to under-testing or limited reporting.
